# Scratch Warner

Scratch Warner is a Chrome extension made by [Dinosu](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Dinosu), designed to protect against accidentally being muted for accidentally saying something against Scratch's censor bot, or being banned for accidentally saying something against the Community Guidelines.

### Installation and basic usage

Download the Scratch Warner files from this Github repository and load them into chrome://extensions in developer mode as explained in [this article](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/). At this point, if you attempt to comment any of the following (not case-sensitive):
- "repl.co"
- "Discord"
- "Scratch Addons"

then a message will appear that looks something like the red text here:
![comment censor message](https://assets.scratch.mit.edu/internalapi/asset/89acbb13875191248938c15013db2f89.png/get/)

### Adding examples

Any time you get muted for accidentally saying something, you can add it to the blacklist. If you see the Scratch Warner extension icon in your extensions bar at the top right of your browser page, click on it to bring up a popup. If not, press the puzzle piece in that area and press the pin icon next to the Scratch Warner icon. It should then show up in your extensions bar, and you can click it.

In the popup, you will see a list of all the strings you will currently be warned about, an "x" next to each of them, and an input box. To add a blacklisted string, simply enter it in the input box and press "enter." To remove an item from the blacklist, press the "x" next to it.

If there is something essential that you think is missing from the blacklist, please do not hesitate to comment so on [Dinosu's profile](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Dinosu#comments), but please do not mention the name of this extension. Simply comment "add ... to the blacklist," or something similar.

### Credits

The original Scratch Warner icon was created by [Turtsles](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Turtsles), prior to a large redesign by [Dinosu](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Dinosu) that changed everything but the red background and exclamation mark.
